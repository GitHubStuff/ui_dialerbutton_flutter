# SETUP

- Find/Replace `ui_dialerbutton_flutter` to name of the name of the package (ex: `flutter_rocks`), using the folder the of the package is a good practice, but not an absolute.

- Follow the instructions in the **/example/README.md** to have the demo app show features of the package with a live demo for dark, light, and system themes.

- Address the *TODO:* in files in the **/example** folder by adding code from the package
